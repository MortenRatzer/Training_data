This is the only document the colleagues needs to download in order to start working on the recommendation systems training data. when opening this document, the user must download the file in a CSV file. 

The Task_Notebook.ipynb file is the jupyter notebook file containing the script used to concatenate the four different CSV files from the groupjens.com website.
